# Quick Note #

Designed for the native Boost experience in Moodle 4.4 and 4.5+, QuickNote helps students capture important excerpts while reading course materials, connect those excerpts to personal reflections, and return to the exact place where learning happened. For teachers and administrators, it provides simple controls to decide when and where the tool is available.

Instead of forcing learners to copy text into external apps, QuickNote keeps the study workflow inside Moodle. Students can highlight a passage, save it instantly as a quote, add their own interpretation, and revisit the original context later through browser text-fragment navigation. The result is a cleaner, more focused note-taking experience that supports active reading, revision, and deeper engagement with course content.

## ✨ Features

- **Granular Control:** Advanced settings for site administrators (page exclusions, default policies) and teachers (toggle visibility per course or specific pages).
- **Default Site Policy**: Administrators can define whether the feature should be enabled or disabled by default for newly configured courses.
- **Highlight to Note**: Students can select text anywhere inside a course page and use a floating action button to save the selection instantly as a quote.
- **Scroll to Text Fragments**: Quote references use browser text fragments (`#:~:text=`), allowing QuickNote to return users to the exact original passage and highlight it visually.
- **Quote and Reflection Separation**: The interface clearly separates the quoted course text from the student's own annotation or reflection.
- **Native Sidebar Drawer**: Notes are managed inside a right-hand sidebar drawer integrated with the Boost user experience, accessible from a floating action button or navigation entry point.
- **Notes Center (view.php):** A dedicated dashboard for students to view all their notes with Global Search, Course Filtering, sorted by last modified date, and equipped with Pagination (configurable display limits) for optimal database performance.
- **PDF and Markdown Export:** Students can export their compiled notes and reflections directly from the Notes Center to a PDF and Markdown file.
- **Auto-save & Core Safety**: Notes are saved automatically via Moodle AJAX services. Includes native Backup & Restore support and automatic deletion of notes when a user is unenrolled.
- **Search and Management**: Students can filter notes in real time and delete notes they no longer need.

## ✅ Prerequisites

- Moodle `4.4+` (Compatible with Moodle < 4.4 down to `4.1` with limitations, see below)
- Boost theme
- Boost child themes are also supported

QuickNote is designed natively for the Moodle Boost interface. Compatibility with non-Boost themes is not the primary target.

## ⚙️ Configuration

QuickNote includes controls for both site administrators and course teachers.

### Administrator settings

Administrators can define the default behavior for new courses:

1. Go to `Site administration > Plugins > Local plugins > QuickNote`.
2. Configure the default state for the plugin:
   `Enabled` or `Disabled` for courses that have not yet been individually configured.

This allows institutions to decide whether QuickNote should be available broadly by default or enabled selectively.

### Teacher course settings

Teachers can control QuickNote per course:

1. Open the target course.
2. Go to the course settings form.
3. Find the `QuickNote` section.
4. Enable or disable QuickNote for that course.

### Advanced Permissions (Capabilities)

QuickNote integrates natively with Moodle's Role and Permission system through the `local/quicknote:use` capability. This provides administrators and teachers with powerful granular control over **who** can use the tool:

- **Role-based Access:** By default, Students, Teachers, and Managers have permission to use QuickNote. You can easily remove this capability from specific roles (like Guests or custom Auditor roles) at the system or course level.
- **Individual Student Restrictions:** If a specific student is misusing the tool, you don't need to disable QuickNote for the entire class. An administrator can create a custom role (e.g., "QuickNote Restricted") with the `local/quicknote:use` capability set to **Prohibit**. A teacher can then assign this role to that specific student in the course, instantly hiding the tool only for them, while the rest of the class continues using it normally.

> [!NOTE]
> **Moodle < 4.4 Compatibility**: The course-level toggle within the course settings form is only supported on Moodle 4.4+. In Moodle versions older than 4.4, the plugin will run based on the default site-wide policy defined by the administrator, as older Moodle core versions do not support local plugin settings injection on the course edit form.

This makes it easy to align the tool with the pedagogical design of each course.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Data Access vs UI Visibility**: Disabling QuickNote at the course level completely blocks the API, making it secure for exams. However, disabling it via per-activity overrides only hides the UI; students can still access their notes on other course pages.

### Backup and Restore

When backing up a course, QuickNote preserves your course and activity-level settings. **Student notes and reflections are intentionally excluded** from course backups to protect student privacy and ensure personal data is not leaked when courses are restored or shared.

## 📦 Installation

QuickNote can be installed like any standard Moodle local plugin.

### Option 1: Install from ZIP

1. Download the plugin ZIP package.
2. Log in to Moodle as an administrator.

## 🧭 Usage

QuickNote is designed to be simple for students from the first interaction.

1. Open any supported course page.
2. Select a meaningful excerpt from the learning material.
3. Click the floating button that appears near the selection.
4. QuickNote saves the selected passage as a quote and opens the sidebar drawer.
